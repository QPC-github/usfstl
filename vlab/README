Here's a "virtual lab" which lets you run Linux machines with WiFi
(via hwsim) and very simple Ethernet (via the controller) in a
virtual, completely simulated environment.

There are certain software requirements for it, which are described
in the shell.nix file. If you have nix-shell installed, you can just
run

	nix-shell --pure --run 'make tests'

or similar. If you have all the requirements locally, then of course

	make tests

will work.

This leaves the logs in the logs/ folder.

If you want to see something, run

	make && ./examples/eth-ping.sh

or

	make && ./examples/hwsim-ibss.sh

(with or without nix-shell) instead.
